# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is teh code that styles web content. List HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
For example, this CSS selects a paragraph text, setting the color to red, width to 500px and border to 1 px solid black-

    p {
        color: red;
        width: 500px;
        border: 1px solid black;
    }

## Anatomy

The whole structure is called a ruleset (or a rule). It has the following parts-

* Selector - This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled.
* Declaration - This is a single rule like `color: red`. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
* Properties - These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (color is a property of the `<p>` elements). In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
* Property value - After the colon in a property is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (there are many color values in addition to red).

To add CSS to an HTML document, we ned to add the following line in `<head>`-

    <link href="/path/to/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

## Selectors

| Selector Name | What does it select | Example |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:--------|
| Element selector ( tag or type selector)| All HTML elements of the specifier type | `p` -> selects `<p>` |
| ID selector | The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique. | `#my-id` -> selects `<p id="my-id">` |
| Class selector |The element(s) on the page with the specifier class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page | `.my-class` -> selects `<p class="my-class">` |
| Attribute selector | The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute |`img[src]` -> selects `<img src="myimage.png">` but not `<img>` |
| Pseudo-class selector | The specifier element(s), but only when in the specifier state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link) | `a:hover` -> selects `<a>`, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link |

## Boxes

CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on a page has properties like

* `padding` - The space around the content.
* `border` - The solid line that is just outside the padding
* `margin` - The space around the outside of the border
